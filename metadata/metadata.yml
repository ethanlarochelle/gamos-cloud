name: Cloud deployment of GEANT4-GAMOS with tissue optics plugin
description: "A parallel container-based implementation of GAMOS for Monte Carlo modeling
  radiation-induced light transport using on-demand cloud infrastructure.\n\nThis
  work advances a Monte Carlo (MC) method to combine ionizing radiation physics with
  optical physics, in a manner which was implicitly designed for deployment with the
  most widely accessible parallelization and portability possible.  \nThe current
  work updates a previously developed optical propagation plugin for GEANT4 architecture
  for medically oriented simulations (GAMOS). A method to programmatically deploy
  multiple containers to achieve parallel execution using an on-demand cloud-based
  infrastructure is presented. A container-based GAMOS deployment is demonstrated
  using a multi-layer tissue model and both optical and X-ray source inputs."
